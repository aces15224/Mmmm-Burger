# Mmmmmm-Burger


* Mmmmmm-Burger is a restaurant app that lets its users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page, in the menu area.  

* Each burger in the waiting area includes an "Eat it!` button. When the user clicks this button, the burger will be moved to the right side of the page in the "Previosly enjoyed" section.  

* The Mmmmmm-Burger app stores every burger in a database, regardless of whether or no the burger has been devoured or not.
